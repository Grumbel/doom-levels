Grumbel's Doom Level Collection
===============================

This is a collection of some custom Doom levels I created back in
1995, nothing special compared to other stuff out there.

* `2-Wege2.wad` [02] - basic level, not all that interesting

* `doomiq.wad` [01] - best level of this collection

* `ingo.wad` [01] - you start in a sewer, also reasonably good

* `kreis.wad` [] - broken, crashes when started

* `prison.wad` [02] - very short level, you start in a prison

The levels are compatible with Freedoom and can be started with:

    $ freedom -file WADFILE

To jump to the level, start the game as usual and then jump to the
level via the cheat code:

    idclevNN

Replace NN with the number given in the [], i.e. `idclev02`.
